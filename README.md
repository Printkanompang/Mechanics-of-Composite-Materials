Hi guys!

Hi guys!

Thanks for joining us for Chulalongkorn University's Mechanics of Composite Materials (2103-510) course. 
This is a hands-on, portfolio-based course. The course is built with an open-source license so after you fork the repository it's yours!

This repository is a collection of computational modules in mechanical engineering for undergraduate students
who are interested in compressible fluid dynamics. These materials are a combination of 
work from Prof.Pairod Singhatanadgid at Chulalongkorn University Mechanical Engineering Department 
and Me, Pakorn Boonpetch.

The course content: 
Basic concepts of fiber-reinforced composite materials and their applications. Introduction to material
fabrication and testing. Stress and strain analysis of continuous fiber composite materials. Hooke's law
and hygrothermal behavior of orthotropic lamina. Classical lamination theory, failure criterion, and
design philosophies, as applied to structural polymeric composite. Analysis of composite beams and
plates.
